                    <h4>ü•ï Getting Started with Cooking</h4>
                    <h5>Before diving into recipes and sizzling pans, it's essential to build a solid foundation in basic cooking techniques. These early skills not only make cooking safer and more efficient, but they also boost your confidence in the kitchen.</h5>
                    <h4>üî™ Mastering Knife Skills</h4>
                    <h5>Learning how to chop, slice, and dice properly is one of the most fundamental cooking skills. It improves speed, consistency, and safety. Start by practicing your grips, basic cutting/chopping, and keeping your knifes clean and sharp.</h5>
                    <h4>üìö Understanding Cooking Terminology</h4>
                    <h5>Cooking instructions often use specific terms that can be confusing for beginners. Familiarising yourself with common vocabulary such as 'saut√©', 'simmer', etc. helps you follow recipes more accurately and communicate better in culinary settings.</h5>
                    <h4>üßÇ Ingredient Preparation & Organisation</h4>
                    <h5>Preparation is key to cooking smoothly. This includes measuring ingredients with proper tools depending on dry or liquid ingredients, and reading recipes carefully so you know the proper steps.</h5>

                    <h4>üëÖ Taste as You Cook</h4>
                    <h5>Tasting throughout the cooking process can let you balance flavours, let you check whether you need less or more seasoning, and you can monitor the texture of your food.</h5>
                    <h4>üîÅ Learn from Every Dish</h4>
                    <h5>If you feel that your dish wasn't perfect, you can always improve by taking notes of what was good and what was bad, then try cooking the same dish again with what you've learnt!</h5>

                <h4>üî• Frying Pans</h4>
                <h5>You can fry, saut√©, and do more with it. Nonstick pans are great for beginners, but you should avoid using metal utensils on nonstick pans to avoid scratching them. Use wooden or plastic tools instead.</h5>

                <h5>A board for you to cut and slice items. It's available in many different materials, colours, and sizes! Heads up: you should use different chopping boards when cutting vastly different ingredients such as vegetables and raw meat to prevent contamination!</h5>

                <h4>‚ö° Microwaves</h4>
                <h5>Usually used for heating up food quickly. Nothing special about microwaves, except that you shouldn't throw any random food into microwaves as that may cause some foods to just "self-destruct".</h5>
